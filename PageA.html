    <h1>DATA1100 assignment</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Imagine that three years from now, you have finished your 
        degree at OsloMet and have just been recruited to one of 
        the largest consultancy firms in Norway. In the first week
        in your new position, you are told by your supervisor that,
        in addition to your individual tasks, you will be working
        with a small team of 5-6 people, who regularly meet to discuss
        and find good balanced solutions to complex situations and problems
        within the company or society in general. </p>
    
    <h3> Case </h3>
    <p>Your first assignment as a group is to investigate the pros/cons
        of working in a group. In what areas can you contribute. What sort
        of situations, problems or cases are best solved in groups? What does
        this way of working say about what your company focuses on? </p>

    <p>My VGS greeted their students with free breakfast in the morning and the teachers were very friendly. 
        The canteen sold a variety of food and you could always find something to enjoy. My friends and I used
         to study up until late at the library and also use the gym once a week.</p>

    <P>I went to Edvard munch high school, there were mostly girls. A class consisted of about ninety percent girls and ten percent guys. 
        Luckily the guys in my class were cool, and we ended up becoming good friends.</p>

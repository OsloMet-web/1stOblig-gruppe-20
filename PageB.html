    <p>My VGS greeted their students with free breakfast in the morning and the teachers were very friendly. 
        The canteen sold a variety of food and you could always find something to enjoy. My friends and I used
         to study up until late at the library and also use the gym once a week.</p>

    <p>My VGS relied heavily on their athletics and gave a lot of focus to the students wanting to do sports, 
        by facilitate the classes around training, witch I enjoyed. 
        The teachers had a good understanding around students prioritizing sports,
    and the workload was adjusted around this. This made me, and other students, excel in both sports and school 
    by giving us freedom to figure thing out ourselves. </p>

    <p>I went to Edvard Munch VGS where most of the students were girls. In my class there were 27 girls and 5 guys.
        Luckily the guys in my class where cool, so we ended up becoming really good friends.
        The school used to be an art school, before it was turned into a high school.</p>

        not the best when it comes to activities and spots, the school mainly focus on acadamic things.</p>
